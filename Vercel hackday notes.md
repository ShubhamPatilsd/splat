**GESTURE MAPPING**

- SWAPPING BETWEEN PHYSICS AND DRAWING MODE IS wakanda forever

drawing mode:
- right hand (drawing):
	- pinching index and thumb draws
- left hand:
	- changing brush between pencil, marker, eraser, fill is open palm facing camera
	- choosing material of current drawing from llm suggestions is fist with palm facing user
  
physics mode:
- by default, hands interact with things
	- pinching picks stuff up
- splat with both hands does gaussian splat
- pointing with right index while left hand is posed in certain way changes gravity


**FEATURES**

- Collaboration w multiple ppl squares


**BUGS**

- when second hand enters frame box is set
- pinch detection inconsistent in some cases
